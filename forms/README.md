# Forms

## General Guidelines

### The path to completion should be clear

* Use wizards to break long forms
* Indicate completion progress and if possible, allow users to save progress
* Make primary and secondary call-to-action buttons distinct and obvious
* Call-to-action labels should be short and clear

### The form should be easy to understand

* Choose field types appropriately - this reduces confusion and makes data collected easier to process
* Group related fields
* Label fields as optional instead of compulsory
* Avoid using asterisks to mark compulsory fields
* Do not use placeholders to replace labels
* Use autocomplete

### Feedback on interaction should be given

* Field validation should be inline \(Display errors next to the field\)
* Avoid using aggressive tone in error messages
* Validate inputs in real-time
