# Considerations

## Responsive design

Use responsive classes to define how the grid behaves at different screen sizes.

## Breakpoints

Under the grid system, each column's width can be defined for a specific viewport size: mobile, tablet, desktop, widescreen and full HD.

## Grid

Grids are fundamental to the structure of content, affecting placements and spacing from individual components to pages. We use bootstrap's powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.

#### Grid System

The grid is similar to the [**bootstrap grid system**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/). This means you can access different breakpoints for each value

xs : 576px  
sm : : 768px  
md :: 992px  
lg : 1200px
